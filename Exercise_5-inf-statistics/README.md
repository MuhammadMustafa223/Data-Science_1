# Exercise Sheet 5 - Data Analysis and Statistical Testing

## Overview
This exercise focuses on data analysis using Python, covering data visualization, statistical analysis, and hypothesis testing. The exercise is designed to test understanding of fundamental statistical concepts and their implementation using popular Python libraries.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Libraries:
  - pandas
  - seaborn
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - scipy

## Data
- Titanic Dataset (`titanic.csv`)
- Custom sampling data (`sample.npy`)
- Group comparison time measurement data (provided in the notebook)

## Exercise Structure

### Exercise 1 (10%) - Titanic Data Analysis
- Analysis of ticket prices across passenger classes
- Creation of visualizations using Seaborn
- Comparison of mean and median ticket prices
- Implementation of bar plots with statistical annotations

### Exercise 2 (40%) - Statistical Sampling and Bootstrapping
1. Gaussian Distribution Analysis (10%)
   - Creating sampling distributions
   - Visualizing distributions with different sample sizes
   - PDF comparison with histograms

2. Standard Deviation Analysis (5%)
   - Comparison of sampling distribution vs. Gaussian distribution
   - Analysis of the Law of Large Numbers

3. Confidence Interval Calculation (10%)
   - Bootstrap implementation
   - 95% confidence interval calculation
   - Empirical value comparison

4. Hypothesis Testing (15%)
   - Null hypothesis testing (H₀: μ = 5)
   - Bootstrap-based significance testing
   - Statistical decision making

### Exercise 3 (50%) - Group Comparison Analysis
1. Hypothesis Formation (5%)
   - Definition of H₀ and H₁
   - Assessment of group independence

2. Statistical Assumptions Testing (30%)
   - Normality testing using Shapiro-Wilk test
   - Variance homogeneity testing using Levene's test

3. Final Analysis (15%)
   - Selection and implementation of appropriate statistical test
   - Results interpretation and conclusion
